    "about": {
        "p1": "I work at the intersection of engineering design, infrastructure operations, and modern AI-driven automation. Since 2006, I have been involved in the full lifecycle of gas pipeline and compressor station projects: from FEED and detailed design to commissioning support, technical documentation control, and regulatory compliance.",
        "p2": "For me, professional growth is not about climbing a career ladder, but about expanding horizons and applying expertise where it creates the most value. I believe in building systems that make complex processes transparent, reliable, and future-ready.",
        "p3": "Since 2023, I have been actively integrating into the IT and AI ecosystem, focusing on Large Language Models (LLM) and engineering automation within the infrastructure projects domain. I develop Python- and LLM-powered tools that classify technical documents, detect inconsistencies, generate analytical insights, and simplify complex engineering workflows. My work combines domain expertise with modern digital capabilities.",
        "p4": "My mission is to bridge traditional engineering with next-generation digital transformation, enabling infrastructure projects to operate with greater clarity, precision, and intelligence."
