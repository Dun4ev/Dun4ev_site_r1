-                    I am a highly qualified energy infrastructure expert based in <span className="text-teal-300 font-medium">Belgrade, Serbia</span>. With over 18 years of experience managing large-scale gas pipeline and compressor station projects, I specialize in bridging the gap between traditional engineering and modern digital solutions.
+                    I work at the intersection of engineering design, infrastructure operations, and modern AI-driven automation. Since 2006, I have been involved in the full lifecycle of gas pipeline and compressor station projects: from FEED and detailed design to commissioning support, technical documentation control, TOIR workflows, and regulatory compliance.

-                    My professional philosophy isn't just about climbing the ladder—it's about building systems that make complex processes transparent, reliable, and future-ready. I have extensive experience in <span className="text-slate-200 font-medium">FEED documentation</span>, stakeholder negotiations, and regulatory compliance (PED, ATEX, Ex, CE).
+                    For me, professional growth is not about climbing a career ladder, but about expanding horizons and applying expertise where it creates the most value. I believe in building systems that make complex processes transparent, reliable, and future-ready.

-                    Beyond traditional engineering, I am passionate about <span className="text-slate-200 font-medium">Digital Transformation</span>. I develop custom tools using <span className="text-teal-300">Python</span> and <span className="text-teal-300">Excel (Power Query)</span> to automate engineering workflows, analyze big data trends, and optimize technical documentation.
+                    Over the last three years, I have been actively integrating into the IT and AI ecosystem, focusing on Large Language Models and engineering automation. I develop Python- and LLM-powered tools that classify technical documents, detect inconsistencies, generate analytical insights, and simplify complex engineering workflows. My work combines domain expertise with modern digital capabilities, creating solutions that enhance decision-making and reduce operational ambiguity.
