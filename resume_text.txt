Общие сведения
Highly qualified energy infrastructure expert with 18+ years
of experience in managing large-scale gas pipeline and
compressor station projects. Skilled in project coordination, FEED
documentation, stakeholder and supplier negotiations. Strong
background in digital transformation and automation of engineering
workflows.
Experienced in optimizing technical documentation by implementing
automated change management systems, data structuring, and
analytics. Developed custom tools in Excel (Power Query) and
Python to improve efficiency, ensure compliance, and reduce project
risks.
Familiar with Agile/Scrum practices and iterative delivery in
